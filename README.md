# Nogometni klub Zlata Å¾oga

This is a project to show my knowledge and ability to build web pages.

## File Structure

### `index.php`

The main page of the website, which includes several sections:

- **Header**: Contains the logo and navigation menu.
- **Main Content**:
  - **Home Section**: Introduction to the football club.
  - **Activities Section**: Information about the club's activities.
  - **Testimonials Section**: Displays member testimonials.
  - **Announcements Section**: Latest news and announcements.
- **Footer**: Contains additional navigation links and social media icons.

### `dodajIzjavo.php`

The admin page for adding new testimonials. This page includes a form where users can enter their name, date, testimonial, and upload an image.

### `dogodki.php`

A PHP script that retrieves testimonials from the database and outputs them as a JavaScript object. This script is included in the `index.php` file to dynamically load testimonials.

### `assets/css/slog.css`

The CSS file that styles the website, including layout, fonts, colors, and responsive design.

## Usage

### Setting Up the Database

Ensure you have a MySQL database set up with the following tables:

- `customers`: Stores customer information.
- `images`: Stores image file paths and filenames.
- `statements`: Stores testimonials, linking to customers and images.

### Configuration

Edit the database connection details in `dodajIzjavo.php` and `dogodki.php` to match your database configuration:

```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "your_username";
$password = "your_password";
$dbname = "your_database";
```
## Running the Application

1. Place the project files on your web server.
2. Navigate to `index.php` to view the main website.
3. Navigate to `dodajIzjavo.php` to add new testimonials.

## Form Submissions

### `dodajIzjavo.php`

Handles form submissions to add new testimonials to the database. The form includes fields for the name, date, testimonial text, and an image upload.

### `index.php`

Includes a subscription form for newsletters. When the form is submitted, it displays a welcome message and hides the form.

## JavaScript Functionality

### Loading Testimonials

The `index.php` file includes a script that dynamically loads testimonials using data retrieved from `dogodki.php`.

### Form Interactions

- **Newsletter Subscription**: Displays a welcome message on form submission.
- **Close Button**: Hides the welcome message when clicked.

## Styling

The website uses custom CSS (`assets/css/slog.css`) for styling, including layout adjustments, font settings, and responsive design.

## Images and Assets

- Logo and icons are stored in `assets/images/`.
- The CSS file is stored in `assets/css/slog.css`.
- The JavaScript file is dynamically generated by `dogodki.php`.
